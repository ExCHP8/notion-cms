## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- d60bd35: Upd: No longer support cjs.

  New: Support rendering link preview blocks.

  New: Add a loading spinner that reports to the terminal for some feedback.

  Upd: Alias `fetch` at `pull` which will match future `push` commands better.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- f493c16: Fix: Caching was broken by a typo in the options checking mechanism in last release.

  Fix: Make sure that the refresh timeout gets set properly whether a number or string is used.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 521cc9e: Upd: Support mermaid as a highlight js lang.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1575bff: New: Support Notion Link-to-page blocks including with custom renderers.

  New: Support multiple instances of NotionCMS in a project. Before this was limited because they would share a cache which would break things. Fixed by using unique identifiers (last 4 digits of the Notion database id) in the cache name.

  New: Add `_createCMSWalker` static utility class for quickly creating tree walker (walkjs) functions with the appropriate settings for when developing plugins that utilize the `post-tree` hook.

  Upd: Add more API and page stats in CMS metadata and update `duration` to `durationSeconds` for clarity.

  Fix: Make sure that the page content filter accounts for the `post-tree` case where the parent exists.

### Patch Changes

- e4423de: Upd: convert all tests to typescript.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a3fa1f3: New: support markdown and plaintext in content object.
  New: add support for unlimited database pages and unlimited blocks per page.
  New: add support for human readable strings in cache timeout option.
  New: add run duration stats.
  Fix: use Marked options instead of `used` for extensions as they bleed to all instances of Marked (uses a singleton under the hood).
  Fix: update mis-typed Notion Block Object Responses.
  Fix: proper access kitchen sink test object to fix render test.
  Fix: ensure route array is populated.

- 4e9f98c: Fix: Remove debug console logs from tests

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Upd: add p (and other) tags back into render by taking a parsing pass at the full markdown file generated by marked.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 60efae2: Fix: Address deeply nested rendering bugs by pulling in the Notion-Blocks-HTML-parser (Thanks @notion-stuff) and reworking some of the internals.
  Fix: Remove deprecated `headerIds` option in `marked` and instead use the header-id extension.

  Fix: Proper error handling and fallback to using fresh Notion API call when cache fails.
  Upd: Improve test coverage to 95+, remove unused code.
  Upd: Expose tree walking filter as static utility class for use in plugins.

### Patch Changes

- 78be33a: If a coverImage property exists, don't overwrite it when we look for the backup cover image.
- 5866586: Add working sourcemaps to the build.

## 0.3.0

  Upd: Remove ancestor nodes from public API.
  Upd: Add support for starting a walk/async walk from a partial path.
  New: Add helper method to capture only page data and remove that pages children. Useful for sending individual page data to client without sending its sub tree.

### Patch Changes

- 84433cb: Upd: remove otherProps to keep from polluting final tree structure. Guide users down the path of building plugins to extract props at an earlier stage.
- 8ae6713: New: add support for a plugin function returning an array with multiple plugin hook executors.
- 41015e2: Fix: increase page size to maximum number of blocks when pulling page content.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 93cc1e0: Improved the internal CMS tree building algorithm and added public API for walking the tree.

  This fixed a bug where deeply nested pages didn't get inserted into the tree as intended, another bug
  where searching for pages by their key didn't allow for duplicated keys at different places in the structure.

  Rewrote tests to be more maintainable and test all public API surfaces.

  Added references to ancestor nodes in the CMS tree for usage in plugins. This required proper serialization/deserialization
  of objects with circular references (the ancestors) but also functions, which are required in the templating plugin and are generally useful to store in the cache.
